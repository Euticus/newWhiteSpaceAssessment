This is for the WhiteSpace Assessment! 

clone down and run in any Java environment

There are 4 Classes: 

	1. FileReader 
	
		-- reads seedData.txt and seedData2.txt 
		
		-- filters data into 3 ArrayList<String>() 
		
	2. RomanNumber 
	
		-- recursively converts any string of Roman Numerals into integers 
		
	3. RosettaStone 
	
		-- further filters data from FileReader into TreeMaps to access for later calculations 
		
		-- calculates a multiplier 'element' and stores in another TreeMap 
		
		-- creates ArrayList<String> promptAnswers 
		
	4. GalaxyDriver 
	
		-- a humorously named driver class to do everything 
		
		-- calls getTheMeaningOfLife() from the RosettaStone class to print answers 
		

Tests include: 
	-- two seed files for further test cases 
	
	-- 3 unit tests ensuring createValues() , createMultipliers(), and createPrompts() in the RosettaStone class are used properly 
	
	-- 1 end-to-end test for both seed files
